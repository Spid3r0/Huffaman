# Huffman
Basic C++ implementation of huffman coding. I write this code for my Data Structure and Algortihm Project, I wrote my own code with the help of various examples on github. Compared to general examples, it is an example written without using the Heap libary.


## What is Huffman Coding

A data compression technique called Huffman coding seeks to express commonly used data encodings with fewer codes. The amount of data needed for data storage or transfer can be decreased thanks to this technology, which enables frequently used data to be expressed in shorter codes based on the frequency of the data.
